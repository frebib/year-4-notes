# Exercise 3

Finish the proof that reverse = fastrev, started in the lecture. The key lemma
is in the notes, but try to come up with it yourself!

Complete as many of the tasks below you can, as far as you can:
- Show that (Nat, +, 0) is a commutative monoid.
- Define the type of integers Int.
- Define addition and subtraction for integers.
- Show that (Int, +, 0, -) forms an abelian group.
- Define multiplication for Nat. 
- Show that (Nat, +, 0, x, 1) forms a semi-ring.

Note: For the definitions of the concepts above you may use standard on-line
resources (Wikipedia is good enough). 

Note: In order to receive credit you don't have to finish a proof. Formalising
the problem, starting the proof, identifying key lemmas are all creditable
partial results!
