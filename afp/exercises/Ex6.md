# Exercise 6

1. Implement some standard library functions for Vec:
  1. head / tail
  2. append
  3. reverse
  4. map
  5. fold
2. Consider several implementations of "safe indexed access" in order to
   examine the various trade-offs you need to make. 
3. Implement an Agda data-type for "singleton" natural numbers, where `m :
   Singleton n` if and only if `m = n`. Consider addition and its properties on
   this type. Consider an implementation of safe indexed access which uses this
   type.
