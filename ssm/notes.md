## Introduction (26/09/2017)

### Content
- Asset registers

- Risk and threat analysis and modelling
  - What are we securing against?

### Exercises/Suggestions
- A load of suggestions in the slides for stuff. Will probably go into detail later.

### Cycle of quality systems 03/10/2017
- Plan
  - Identify assets, risks, threats
  - Associate controls
- Do
  - Run the system with new controls
- Check
  - Design and collect metrics
  - Design and collect audit info
  - Assess the success of the system
- Act
  - Improve the system
  - Return to "do" (or "plan")


- ISO 9001

## Manufacturing
- **Policies:** state objectives and criteria of system
- **Procedures:** state how to do things, check to ensure fulfilment of policy objectives
- **Work Instructions** or **Method Statements:** done in more detail
- **Quality Records audited:** compliance checked with policies and procedures

### Compliance
- {fill}

### Governance
- Documents approved by named people who are accountable
- Review dates
- Issue/version control
- A way to get "latest" copy, protection against old copies
- Documents flow from requirements

### Document hierarchies
- 27001 offers guidance, other standards may be considered
- {missing info}

### Policies
- Describe how things should be, not how to do them
- Sets objectives and high-level operational requirements
- Written by senior managers, approved by other senior managers or board-level directors
- Short in length, long in duration


- Clear and unambiguous
- Short as possible
- Cover majority of cases, process for dealing with exceptions
- No lengthy background material


**Examples**
- Why are we securing things, and who from?
- Do we prefer cloud or on-premises solutions?
- What legislation do we need to comply with?
- Who approves changes to our security system?

### Procedures
- Describe how to do something correctly
- Can be checked against policies to confirm they implement requirements and objectives (should state which policies they are derived from)
- Generate quality records
- Written by operational managers
- Approved by their line managers


- Step-by-step descriptions of what needs to be done
- Always accurate and up-to-date
- Immediately flagged for review if not working
- Minimise opportunity for people to make inconsistent decisions


**Examples**
- How to deal with new staff
- How to manage departure of staff
- Who can be let into the building at night
- How to provision a new laptop
