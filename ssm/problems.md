# Problem 1
Imagine I have three pieces of data on my laptop
- "Market affecting" information about a company
  which will allow anyone who knows it to make
  money on the stock market
- A spreadsheet containing the bonus payments to
  be made to the staff of my company.
- Information from a whistle-blower which will
  harm another company when I give it to the
  government.

## Exercise 1
Think of the people who might want to attack my
laptop.
- How skilled are they?
- How motivated are they?
  - Motivation includes willingness to break the
    law, willingness to take risks and the size of the
    possible pay-off.
- How resourced are they?

### Suggestions
- Fraudsters
  - Could be very skilled and motivated, but resources?
- Business competitors
  - All three?
- Employees
  - Skilled and motivated, might be able to use my
    resources against me
- My government?
- Other governments?

## Exercise 2
Think of threats to my laptop and to the data on my
laptop.
- Do they affect integrity, confidentiality or
  availability?
- Do they require skill, resource and motivation?
- Don’t just think of subtle crypto attacks: be
  inventive, and be crude!

### Suggestions
- Phishing
- A wide variety of protocol attacks we will talk about
  in Network Security
- Theft
- Blackmail / Coercion
- Cameras / Keyloggers / etc

## Exercise 3
- How would you stop these attacks?
- How difficult, expensive, intrusive are the counter-
measures (we are going to call them controls)?
- Think of costs and unintended consequences?
- Will users accept them?

### Suggestions
- Passwords
- Encryption
- Locks
- Tamper Resistance

## Exercise 4
- How would you measure the benefits of your
  controls?
- How would you audit whether people were
  following your controls?
- What problems might arise?

### Suggestions
- Virus incidents detected
- DLP
- IDS / IPS
- Surprise visits

# Problem 2
## Exercise
- Think about four different people or groups of
  people who might want to attack your business.
- Write down some statements about their capability:
  what can they do, and how well can they do it?
  - Think about this qualitatively (list the things) and
    informally quantitatively (how strong or weak?)
- Write down some statements about their intent:
  what might they want to do, and how likely are they
  to do it?

### Examples
- Nation States: capability high, motive?
- Fraud/Blackmail: capability medium, motive high
- "Script kiddies": capability low, motive low
- Employees: capability medium, motive medium

# Problem 3
## Exercise
- Take five minutes, and build an attack tree for
  changing your end of year marks on a marks
  database.
- Assume the database is on a computer, which is
  behind a firewall, which is administered by an
  administrator and used by lecturer

# Problem 4
## Exercise
- Suppose a tiger team penetrated the network by
  using a security vulnerability on a machine which
  had'nt been patched.
- That’s all you know: "there was a machine, it wasn’t
  patched".
- What might be the reasons it wasn’t patched?

### Causes
- Failure of patching
- Failure to try to patch
- Failure to include in list of machines to match
- Failure to include in list of machines that matter
- Failure to firewall
- Failure to audit
